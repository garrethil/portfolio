          Since 2017, I have been performing as a saxophonist in the Toronto
          area, performing at renowned venues such as Koerner Hall, Drome
          Taberna, and The Rex Hotel. As a multi-instrumentalist, I have honed
          my skills on saxophone and clarinet and I am self taught on guitar,
          flute and piano bringing versatility and depth to my music. In 2019, I
          began exploring the guitar, and by 2020, I was writing and recording
          my own original songs. My journey is rooted in the vibrant Toronto
          music community, where I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in jazz
          performance for saxophone. This foundation has allowed me to blend my
          passion for improvisation with songwriting, creating a unique musical
          voice.
