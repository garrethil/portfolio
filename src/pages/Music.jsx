          Since 2017, I have established myself as a dedicated and versatile
          saxophonist in the vibrant Toronto music scene, performing at
          prestigious venues such as Koerner Hall, DROM Taberna, and The Rex
          Hotel. As a multi-instrumentalist, I have cultivated expertise on the
          saxophone and clarinet while also expanding my repertoire as a
          self-taught guitarist, flutist, and pianist. This breadth of musical
          experience has enriched my artistry, adding depth and versatility to
          my performances.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2019, I began exploring the guitar as a creative outlet, which led
          to writing and recording original compositions by 2020. My journey as
          a musician is deeply intertwined with Toronto's thriving music
          community, where I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in jazz performance for
          saxophone.
          <br />
          <br />
          Although my current focus lies in transitioning into the tech
          industry, my commitment to music remains unwavering. I continue to
          embrace opportunities to perform and collaborate, honoring the
          creative spirit that has guided my career thus far.
